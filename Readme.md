# Docker Basics & Intermediate üöÄüê≥

This document provides an overview of the key topics covered in both sections, along with additional insights into Docker's functionality and best practices.

## üê≥ Docker Basics Overview

### 1. Introduction to Docker & Containerization
- **What is Docker?**  
  Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to build, ship, and run applications in isolated environments called containers. Containers ensure consistency across different environments by packaging the application and its dependencies together.

- **Why Use Containers?**  
  - Portability: Run applications seamlessly across different environments.  
  - Efficiency: Containers share the host OS kernel, making them lightweight.  
  - Scalability: Easily deploy multiple instances of an application.  
  - Consistency: Ensures the same behavior in development, testing, and production.

### 2. Key Concepts
- **Docker Images**: Immutable templates used to create containers.  
- **Docker Containers**: Running instances of Docker images.  
- **Dockerfile**: A script that defines how to build a Docker image.  
- **.dockerignore**: Prevents unnecessary files from being added to the image.  

### 3. Basic Commands
- Build an image: `docker build -t myapp .`  
- Run a container: `docker run -p 3000:3000 myapp`  
- List running containers: `docker ps`  
- Stop a container: `docker stop <container_id>`  
- Remove a container: `docker rm <container_id>`  

### 4. Networking & Volumes
- **Networking**: Use custom networks for container-to-container communication.  
- **Volumes**: Persist data beyond the lifecycle of a container.

## üèóÔ∏è Docker Intermediate Overview

### 1. Multi-Stage Builds
- **Purpose**: Reduce final image size by separating build and production stages.  
- **How-To**: Use multiple `FROM` statements in the Dockerfile to optimize the build process.

### 2. Container Security
- Run containers as non-root users to minimize security risks.  
- Use minimal base images (e.g., `alpine`, `distroless`).  
- Install only production dependencies in the final image.

### 3. Docker Compose
- Simplify multi-container setups with a `docker-compose.yml` file.  
- Define services, networks, and volumes for your application.  
- Start all services with `docker compose up -d`.

### 4. Database Integration
- Use PostgreSQL as the database for the application.  
- Configure the database connection using `@nestjs/typeorm` and environment variables.

## üîç Advanced Concepts

### 1. How Docker Works Under the Hood
- **Docker Daemon**: Manages images, containers, networks, and storage.  
- **Union File System (UnionFS)**: Optimizes storage by layering images.  
- **Namespaces & cgroups**: Provide isolation and enforce resource constraints.

### 2. Optimizing Docker Images
- Use build caching to speed up builds.  
- Minimize image size by using lightweight base images and reducing layers.  
- Analyze image layers with `docker history`.

### 3. Networking in Docker
- **Default Bridge Network**: Containers on the same bridge network can communicate using container names.  
- **Custom Networks**: Recommended for better container-to-container communication.  

### 4. Persistent Storage
- **Named Volumes**: Use `docker volume create` to persist data.  
- **Bind Mounts**: Map host directories to container paths for development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices

1. **Avoid Bloated Images**: Use minimal base images like `alpine`.  
2. **Leverage Build Caching**: Order Dockerfile instructions efficiently.  
3. **Secure Your Containers**: Run as non-root users and use read-only filesystems.  
4. **Manage Environment Variables Securely**: Use `.env` files instead of hardcoding credentials.  
5. **Clean Up Resources**: Use `docker system prune` to remove unused containers, images, and volumes.
